# Todo List Application

This is a simple single-page application built with React and Vite. It allows users to manage a todo list with the following features:

- Add new tasks using an input box and an "Insert" button.
- Edit existing tasks by clicking the "Edit" button.
- Delete tasks by clicking the "Delete" button.

The UI is centered and styled for a clean and user-friendly experience.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
